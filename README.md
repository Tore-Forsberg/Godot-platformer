# Godot Platformer

## Introduction

This project is a simple 2D platformer made using Godot scripted in GDScript. The main purpose of the project is for me to learn the basics of Godot. The current name of the game is `The Adventures of Battery Boy`. The game is currently work in progress and in it's current state not meant to be played for enjoyment.
